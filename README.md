# hangman-python
Simple hangman game written in python. Includes some basic word lists.
This started as a school project but I've uploaded it here for documentation purposes.
I'm releasing this into the public domain because I didn't create this for personal gain and hope it might help another beginner programmer. (forewarning: my code probably isn't that clear, but I've included lots of comments so you can hopefully how everything works)
If you have any questions about this project, please contact me using the email on my github profile.

*Features*

Custom word lists, user can add their own csv files to the "word_lists" folder

User changeable input settings. The user can choose what characters count as valid input using "validinput.txt" in the "config" folder
(useful for foreign characters, allow numbers etc)
